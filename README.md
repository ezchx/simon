Free Code Camp Simon game project.

Similar to the real game, the program displays lighted buttons that the player must imitate. With each successful round, the game adds another button up to a maximum of 20 which is considered a win. If the player pushes an incorrect button in normal mode, the game buzzes and repeats the last sequence. If the player pushes an incorrect button in strict mode, the game buzzes and displays a new sequence of a random length.
